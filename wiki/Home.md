The goal of this project is to create a simple and low cost ultrasound phantom. It is not a calibrated phantom but it could be used for training or testing experimental probes. With a few tests the method can be used to mimic the behavior of certain tissues (elasticity and echogenicity).

This phantom is largely inspired by the work presented in the document [Agar ultrasound phantoms for low-cost training without refrigeration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211419X15001111)

## Design choices

We will only use common, extremly easy to use materials here. It is a phantom that can be stored for several months in the refrigerator.
