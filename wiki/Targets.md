| Pour the mixture into the syringes.<br />Delay cooling to room temperature.<br />To remove the inserts from the mold, simply inject compressed air with a second syringe. |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_02.jpg" alt="step_02" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_03.jpg" alt="step_03" style="zoom:25%;" /> | Store the inserts in the refrigerator until ready to use. |
| Cut two sheets of PMMA in the format adapted to your container<br /> Hold them together and drill them with the 1mm drill bit according to the pattern you want to make.<br />Also make 4 holes of 3mm at the four corners of the sheets.<br />Warning : PMMA and drill bit are quite fragile... |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_04.jpg" alt="step_04" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_05.jpg" alt="step_05" style="zoom:25%;" /> | The sheets are ready to be assembled. |
| Couper 4 tubes d'aluminium à la longueur représentant l'espacement entre les plaques. Il faudra qu'elles rentrent facilement dans votre contenant.<br />Threaded rods will need to be longer to hold the nuts.. |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_06.jpg" alt="step_06" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_07.jpg" alt="step_07" style="zoom:25%;" /> | Assemble the 2 sheets and check one last time that everything fits into the plastic box. After that it will be too late... |
|     |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_08.jpg" alt="step_08" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_09.jpg" alt="step_09" style="zoom:25%;" /> | You can start passing the nylon threads through the holes in the desired pattern. |
| Nylon is very echogenic, here the yellow thread is probably too thick, the thinner purple thread is sufficient.. |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_10.jpg" alt="step_10" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_11.jpg" alt="step_11" style="zoom:25%;" /> | Small crushed metal tubes can be used to block the wires.. |
| Be careful not to overtighten the wires otherwise the plates may break.. |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_12.jpg" alt="step_12" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_13.jpg" alt="step_13" style="zoom:25%;" /> | |
| We have to remove the threaded rods and nuts that are no longer useful.<br /> To make the sheets hold together we are going to glue the aluminium tubes directly onto the PMMA. |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_14.jpg" alt="step_14" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_15.jpg" alt="step_15" style="zoom:25%;" /> | Then we remove the threaded rods. |
|     |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_16.jpg" alt="step_16" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_17.jpg" alt="step_17" style="zoom:25%;" /> | Inserts can be prepared by cutting them in half, for example, to have interesting shapes.. |
| They are held in place with metal needles.<br /> Avoid rusting iron and use plastic, copper or aluminum instead.. |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_18.jpg" alt="step_18" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_19.jpg" alt="step_19" style="zoom:25%;" /> | The system is... |
| ... ready to ... |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_20.jpg" alt="step_20" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
| <img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_21.jpg" alt="step_21" style="zoom:25%;" /> | ... be placed in the plastic box. |
| Take a final shot of the content for comparison with what you see on the ultrasound scan.. |<img src="/echopen-foundation/echolab_phantom/blob/main/docs/img/step_22.jpg" alt="step_22" style="zoom:25%;" />  |
